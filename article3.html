                    The observability provider New Relic has announced the launch of a new change tracking solution to provide full visibility of change events throughout an application’s life cycle.
                    According to New Relic, change events are the cause of most degradations in software performance.
                    “With New Relic change tracking, every engineer, regardless of the specialty, can now understand the impact of a change anywhere in the tech stack to take the fiction out of detection and resolution,” said Manav Khurana, chief growth officer and GM at New Relic.
