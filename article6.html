                    Test environments can be a frustrating bottleneck to the testing process and the software development life cycle as a whole. Whether it be unavailable services, devices, or ever-elusive test data, ensuring the right environment for testing creates potential for barriers to shifting left at speed, and cutting corners can put application quality and your business at risk. 
                    A recent study of 1,000 software developers and startup employees found that at least 29% of organizations are using real customer production data in their testing environments. This poses numerous concerns because utilizing real customer data for testing opens the door for violation of GDPR regulations. This, in turn, can lead to loss of resources and reputation for companies. Furthermore, utilizing real data can be disastrous in the event of a data breach – which 45% of companies report experiencing.                  
                    Luckily, there are several steps testers and dev teams can take to ensure they are both eliminating these concerns and testing efficiently.                      
                    This article will take a closer look at some of the most common environment concerns facing testers and dev teams—including the acquisition of usable test data—and explore solutions to eliminating these concerns that fit seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline.                 </p>
